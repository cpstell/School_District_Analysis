# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

A school disctrict asked for a snapshot of several important metrics by each school and also at the disctrict level. The analysis focused on math and reading scores in preparation for an upcoming board meeting. After reviewing the data it was determined that Thomas High School's 9th grade class was thought to be cheating. The school board asked for the data to be analyzed again to be sure of their results. Below are a few of the items we will be reviewing for anomalies.

* The affect on the district summary.
* The affect on the school summary.
* The affect of replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores in relation to Thomas High School’s performance.

## Summary

The analysis of the Thomas High School data reveals of few key items of significance. It is interesting to see how budget size, school type, and size of school all play a role in final grades. By removing the ninth grade from the data analysis grades ten through twelve showed an incresse in their scores. I noticed high performing schools faired better than larger schools reagardless of budget size.  A future analysis could further see the affects of school type and size. Have a charter school with a large size compare to a charter school with a small size to study the affects of large versus small size in the same type of school.
